# Planetary Collisions: Mathematical Investigation

### Note: This repo is still a work in progress.

This is my math internal investigation for the IB programme. The premise: under what conditions (specific mass, distance from each other, starting velocity) will two planetary masses that are approaching near each other collide? I use P5.js to model gravitational attraction between planets and collect data.
